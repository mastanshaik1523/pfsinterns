Develop a basic calculator web application that performs arithmetic operations. Use
HTML for the structure of the calculator layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
implementing the calculator's logic. Implement a user interface with buttons for numbers
and operators, and a display area to show the calculation results. Ensure the calculator
performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations accurately.
This project reinforces interns' understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
fundamentals. It also provides experience in building interactive web applications, which
are foundational skills for web development roles.
